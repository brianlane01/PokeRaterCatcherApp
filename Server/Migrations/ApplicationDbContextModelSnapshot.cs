Attacks with a recharge turn, such as hyper beam, do not have to recharge; attacks with a preparation turn, such as fly, do not end up being used.

If this Pokémon is confused, its confusion is not checked when loafing around; the Pokémon cannot hurt itself, and its confusion does not end or come closer to ending.

If it does not attempt to move, e.g. because it is asleep or frozen, whatever it would have done will be postponed until its next attempt; that is, it will either loaf around or move as usual, depending on what it last did.
